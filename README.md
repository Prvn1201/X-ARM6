# Robotic Arm 3D Printing Setup  

This project demonstrates the integration of the XARM6 robotic arm with a 3D printing pen to create a 3D printing system capable of printing on the vertical and horinzontal plane.  

## Features  
1. **Custom Holder**: A 3D-printed holder securely attaches the pen to the robotic arm.  
2. **Circuitry Modification**: The 3D pen's circuitry is modified for integration with the robotic arm.  
3. **G-code Conversion**: Python code converts G-code into commands that the robotic arm can execute.  
4. **Horizontal Plane Printing**: Combines design, coding, and hardware integration to enable printing on the horizontal plane.
4. **Vertical Plane Printing**: Combines design, coding, and hardware integration to enable printing on the vertical plane.  

## Project Files  
- **Code**: Python scripts for G-code conversion and robotic arm control.    
(In the src folder) 
- **3D Models**: STL files for the holder design.  
- **Documentation**: Circuitry modification details and integration steps.  

## How to Use  
1. Attach the 3D-printed holder to the XARM6 robotic arm.  
2. Connect the modified 3D printing pen to the robotic arm.  
3. Run the Python script to load and execute the G-code.  
4. Follow the documentation for step-by-step guidance.  

## Prerequisites  
- XARM6 robotic arm.  
- 3D printing pen (modification required) with the relay for activation.  
- Python 3 installed.  
- Necessary Python libraries (specified in the code).
